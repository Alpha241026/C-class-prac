Well nothing super cool...

=> Basically our C teacher asked us to push the solutions of the problems he made us practice in class as a way of assignment submission...and here we are :)

=> This repo has sub-folders with files categorized together based on the date they were done in one sitting...like C-class-prac (repo) -> #2Feb26 (sub folder) -> file-name.c (file/program)

=> Each solution has the problem statement listed at the start of the code in comments

=> One can run the code by copying it and then testing it locally (or online)
$ gcc file-name.c -o filename 
(an exe file will be generated by the title given after -o like file-name.exe...after that...just run it with dot followed by forward slash and title...like below)
$ ./filename

Hope this helps :)
printf("Thank You ! ... oh and no I didnt use AI for this Readme lol");
